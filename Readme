There are 5 scripts, each of which comes with its own set of input files. Details of each script are given below. Where possible, input files are also provided. Note that some input files are too large to include.


***Script #1***
***Ribo-RET ORF caller 9_3_21.py***

This Python script takes data from two replicate Ribo-RET experiments and infers the position of ORFs. It also creates output files, including graphs for publication-ready figures. Required input files are listed below, with example files included (these files are available on GitHub). 

The script runs in Python v3 and requires that the following modules are installed:
matplotlib.pyplot
numpy as np
pandas
seaborn
datetime
pathlib
subprocess
os
math
random
scipy

The script also requires a local installation of the ViennaRNA Package that includes RNAfold.exe

The user is prompted to provide file paths for input and output files, and filenames for input files. Output files are written to a folder with the date and time included in the folder name.

***Script #2***
***GC skew analysis 9_13_21.py***

This Python script takes a list of ORFs (strand, start/stop coordinates), excludes start and stop codons, determines regions that do not overlap with annotated genes, and for non-overlapping regions determines the G/C content at each codon position on a per-ORF basis, and for all ORFs combined, including a p-value (Fisher's exact test; can be one- or two-tailed).
Required input files are listed below, with example files included (these files are available on GitHub). 

The script runs in Python v3 and requires that the following modules are installed:
matplotlib.pyplot
datetime
os
sys
scipy

The user is prompted to provide file paths for input and output files, and filenames for input files. Output files are written to a folder with the date and time included in the folder name.
The user is also prompted to provide the type of Fisher's exact test to be applied (one-tailed or two-tailed).
